# C++ GPU Model Application

This project is a C++ application designed to perform model inference on a GPU. It utilizes a neural network model to make predictions based on input data. The application is structured to facilitate easy integration and usage of the model with GPU resources.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cpp-gpu-model-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including a compatible C++ compiler and CMake. You may also need GPU drivers and libraries (e.g., CUDA) depending on your hardware.

3. **Build the Project**
   Create a build directory and compile the project using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   After building, you can run the application:
   ```bash
   ./cpp-gpu-model-app
   ```

## Usage

The application initializes the model and sets up GPU resources. You can modify the input data in `src/main.cpp` to test different scenarios. The results of the inference will be displayed in the console.

## Dependencies

- C++11 or higher
- CMake
- GPU drivers and libraries (e.g., CUDA)
